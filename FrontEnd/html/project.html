                    <h2>Embedded chaotic Whale Survival Algorithm for filterâ€“wrapper Feature Selection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Feature selection is an important preprocessing technique which helps to
                        identify the relevant features from a dataset, so we need to reduce the feature dimension 
                        as well improve the classification accuracy at the same time. The binary version of 
                        whale optimization algorithm is a popular Feature Selection technique which is inspired from the 
                        foraging behavior of humpback whales. In this project, an embedded version of WOA called embedded 
                        chaotic whale survival algorithm (ECWSA) has been proposed which uses its wrapper process to achieve 
                        high classification accuracy and a filter approach to further refine the selected subset with low 
                        computation cost. Chaos has been introduced in the ECWSA to guide selection of the type of movement 
                        followed by the whales while searching for prey. A fitness-dependent death mechanism has also been 
                        introduced in the system of whales which is inspired from the real-life scenario in which whales die
                        if they are unable to catch their prey. 
                        <br>
                        The proposed method has been evaluated on 18 well-known UCI datasets and compared with its 
                        predecessors as well as some other popular FS methods. This project has been published on Springer Link.

                    <h2>Deluge based Genetic Algorithm for feature selection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Feature selection methods are used to identify and remove irrelevant and redundant attributes from 
                        the original feature vector that do not have much contribution to enhance the performance of a 
                        predictive model.
                        Meta-heuristic feature selection algorithms, used as a solution to this problem, need to have a good 
                        trade-off between exploitation and exploration of the search space. Genetic Algorithm (GA), a popular 
                        meta-heuristic algorithm, lacks exploitation capability, which in turn affects the local search ability
                         of the algorithm. Basically, GA uses mutation operation to take care of exploitation which has certain 
                         limitations. As a result, GA gets stuck in local optima. To encounter this problem, in the present work,
                          we have proposed Great Deluge Algorithm (GDA), a local search algorithm, with GA. Here 
                          GDA is used in place of mutation operation of the GA.
                        <br>
                        We have applied the DGA on 15 publicly available standard datasets taken from the UCI dataset repository.
                        This project has been published on Springer Link.
